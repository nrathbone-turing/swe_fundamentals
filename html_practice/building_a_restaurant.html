<!-- In this technical lesson, we will be building a restaurant webpage with HTML using the process we have learned. -->

<!-- Purpose: The webpage will showcase the restaurant's name, a short description, their contact information, and a link to their menu.

Content:
- Restaurant name
- Brief description of the restaurant's cuisine and atmosphere
- Phone number and email address
- Link to the restaurant's menu (optional: you can link to an existing online menu or create a placeholder for now) -->

//Imagine you're working for a startup called EcoTrack, which focuses on developing software solutions for environmental monitoring. The company needs a simple program to track daily temperature readings for various locations and to perform basic operations on these readings.
// In this practice activity, you will apply the concepts of declaring, assigning, and manipulating variables to solve a realistic problem. The scenario mirrors the previous lesson, reinforcing your understanding and ability to work with variables.

// Declare Variables and Assign Values

const locationName = "Green Valley";
let temperatureReading = 25.3;
let isVerified = false

// Variable Reassignment

temperatureReading = 26.1
isVerified = true

// Debugging

// console.log(nameOfVariableYouWantToCheck)

console.log(temperatureReading); // 26.1

console.log(isVerified); // true

// Step 1: Create a New File

//touch js_expressions.js to create a file.
//code js_expressions.js to open it.

// Step 2: Write a Constant Expression

//Write an expression that evaluates to the number 10.
//This expression should only use the number itself, not a variable.
//Print the expression to the console by typing the following code and pressing Enter:

10

console.log(10); // 10

// Step 3: Assignment Expression

//Declare a variable named age and assign it the value 25.
//Print the entire assignment expression to the console by typing the following code and pressing Enter:

const age = 25;

console.log(age); // 25

// Step 4: Variable Lookup and Declaration

//Declare a variable named name with the string value "Alice".
//Print the expression that retrieves the value stored in the name variable by typing the following code and pressing Enter:

const name = "Alice";

console.log(name); // "Alice"

// Step 5: Putting it All Together

//Create an expression that calculates the area of a rectangle with a width of 5 and a height stored in the variable height.
//Set height to 8 before the calculation by typing the following code:

const height = 8;

const width = 5;

const area = width * height;

console.log("Area of rectangle:", area); // Area of rectangle: 40

// Final output should be:

// 10

// 25

// Alice

// Area of rectangle: 40
